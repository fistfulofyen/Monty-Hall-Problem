% Monty Hall Problem demonstrated via the Monte Carlo technique
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem
%
% Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 
% Behind one door is a new car; behind the others, goats. 
% You pick a door, say Door #1, but the door is not opened yet.
% Then the host, who knows what's behind the doors, 
% opens another door, say Door #3, which reveals a goat. 
% He then asks you, "Do you want to change your selection?",
% in other words, change your selection from Door #1 to Door #2.
% Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
%
% Most people would say it does not improve you odds of winning
% if you switch doors, since there is a 1/3 probability that
% a particular door hides the car, no matter which door it is.
% The correct answer is yes, it would be to your advantage to switch.
%
% Initially you have a 33% chance of picking the correct door.
% That means there is a 67% chance the "winning" door is
% one of the doors that you didn't pick.  No matter how many other doors
% the host reveals, there is still a 67% chance the winning door is
% one of the doors you didn't pick.  In the case of 3 doors,
% you didn't pick two of them and when the host opened one of the two
% "other" doors, that left one "other" door and that door
% still has a 67% probability of being the winning door.
%
% Look at it another way, by using extremes.
% Let's say there are a million doors and you pick one.
% Your chance of picking the car are 1 in a million,
% and there is a 999,999 in a million chance that the winner is
% one of the other 999,999 doors.  Now the host, knowing which
% doors have goats reveals 999,998 "goat" doors, leaving only one
% other door closed.  Did your chance of picking the correct door
% suddenly increase way up to 50%?  No, of course not - 
% you still have a 1 in a million chance with your original choice of door.
% But there's a 999,999 in a million chance that the car is behind 
% that one, single, other door, so you should switch.
%
% This simulation creates 15,000 experiments.  At each experiment
% the winning door is picked at random and the contestant's door
% is chosen at random.  You can specify whether to switch or not.
% To be more general, you can specify how many doors are there,
% and how many doors to reveal.  The Monte Carlo experiments are run
% and the final percentage is given, along with the theoretical probability.
